# Parallel Differential Evolution Based LSTM Recurrent Neural Network for Traffic Flow Prediction: A Deep Learning Approach
## Requirement
- Tensorflow==1.13.1
- Pandas==0.25.1
- Numpy==1.16.4
## Test
**Run the python code file in the corresponding data set fold under the test fold. For example, to test the 15-min prediction model**
```
python lstm_test_15m.py
```
## Train
**Run the python code file in the corresponding data set fold under the train fold. For example, to train the 15-min prediction model**
```
python delstm_15m.py
```
