# Traffic flow prediction based on PDELSTM
## Requirement
- Tensorflow==1.13.1
- Pandas==0.24.1
- Numpy==1.16.1
- Scipy==1.2.1
## Test
**Run the python code file in the corresponding data set fold under the test fold. For example, to test the 15-min prediction model**
```
python lstm_test_15m.py
```
## Train
**Run the python code file in the corresponding data set fold under the train fold. For example, to train the 15-min prediction model**
```
python delstm_15m.py
```
